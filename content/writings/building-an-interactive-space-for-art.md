Most of my works so far, have aquired their "final" version after several
iterations over the same idea. Final little "tweaks" that make me be
at peace with the piece.

Let's say that this final version has a certain set of values associated
with it. Any variable or probability that controls the flow of thr program
is part of this set.

However, I often find myself having to discriminate between multiple different
sets of values, because each one produces attractive pieces, that could stand
by their own. But I wouldn't like to just clone the whole project, and share
it again with another set.

I think it's better to have a space to interact with the piece, to modify
each variable and watching how it influences the final result.

I have aquired this idea after watching 
[aesthetically pleasing triangle subdivision][tyler-subdivision], and the 
live interactive implementation: [triangle subdivision][depasquale-subdivision].

And then it came to my mind again after seeing it working in 
[GASP Gallery ][gasp-gallery].

And I mean, it'd be nice to be able to be feauterd in GASP Gallery. And I
assume one of the requirements to be featured is to make your code able to be
modified using this sets of values I've talked about.

So that's the project for the next week. Building an online platform for my
works, so each one can be run using this interactive controllers.

Originally meant to be an online platform for **my works**, this turned out to
be [Ginpar][ginpar]: Static content generator for interactive and
parametrisable p5 canvases.
