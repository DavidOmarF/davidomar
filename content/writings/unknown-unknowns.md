So I've been thinking lately what makes a good developer.
There are tons of articles about it, and I'm sure most of them under
striking titles like "x things you must/should learn as a developer".

I firmly believe that the most important traits of a developer goes
well beyond technical capabilities and knowledge, and lies in more
abstract and hard-to-measure things, like meta-thinking.

I'm not aware if there are well backed theories on what is the structure
of knowledge inside our brains. But I think most of use have the ability
to add a layer to it that we can organize by ourselves. (I don't mean
like actually modifying our brains, but thinking about the pieces of
knowledge and how the link between them).

This, for me, would be equivalent to learning the local emergency numbers
when planning a trip to another city. You may not need them right away, or
ever, but if you get into a fire, you'll know you have to call the
firefighters.

I came to the realization that one of those [characteristics] is being aware
of your unknowns. Being aware that you lack knowledge, but at the same time,
knowing where those empty spaces fit in the broader knowledge network.

I think a lot of people is aware of the known and unknowns framework: you have

- **Known knowns**, or things you're aware of and understand,
- **Unknown knowns**, or things you undertand even if you're unaware of,
- **Known unknowns**, or things you're aware of, but don't understand, and
- **Unknown unknowns**, or things you're unaware of, and don't understand.

I'm not sure
