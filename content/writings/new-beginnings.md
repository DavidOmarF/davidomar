I've been rebooting my website at least once a year since I started it.

Originally built with WordPress, adapted to Jekyll, and then decomposed into
different websites (a personal blog, and a blog about art), this particular
domain was pretty much forgotten by me.

Even though it was meant to be a **blog**, I only used it as a landing page.
The information in here eventually got outdated, and the whole project evolved
into a chunk of text that I didn't want to touch out of lazyness.

Today I decided I wanted to totally deprecate the old website, which was a 
heavily modified version of the Jekyll theme [Minimal Mistakes][minimal-mistakes].
I think that the effort once put in the styling was one of the things that stopped
me from dropping it out.

Now I'll be using [Hugo][hugo] and the [Journal][journal] theme. I've already done
some changes so it allows me to put different sections in the index, abling me to
distinguish between my writings and the talks I'm planning to give in the following
months.

I'm going for a more minimalist look. Using lowercase for everything except the body
of the articles. It's a pattern I've found attractive in other websites, and I'm hoping
it will fit well here.

As with all my projects, this will be open sourced. You're completely free to do
whatever you want with this.
