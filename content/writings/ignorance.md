title: "On Ignorance"

So I've been thinking lately what makes a good developer.
There are tons of articles about it, and I'm sure most of them under
striking titles like _"x things you must/should learn as a developer"_,
_"x traits only top notch [developers][developers] have"_, _"the x things to do so
you don't become a pathetic little weasel (as a developer)"_ and whatnot.

I don't love those kind of articles. Mainly because all of them contain
more or less the same information in different order and style.

I'm certain I'm not the first one to propose the following idea as something
that improves your thinking, but I wanted to write about anyway so I think
through it a little bit more.

## Metacognition

I firmly believe that the most important traits of a developer 
(in general, any person) goes well beyond technical capabilities and knowledge,
and lies in more abstract and hard-to-measure things.
In this case, [metacognition or metathinking][metacognition]
---thinking about thinking.

I'm not aware if there are well backed theories on what is the structure
of the knowledge inside our brains, but I think most of use have the ability
to consciously add a layer over it so we can organize our pieces of knowledge
in something like a mind or concept map. I'll refer to this later.

One of the tools that you may use to improve your metacognition is the "known
unknowns" framework. It's similar to the [Johari Window][Johari Window], but it
doesn't take into account what other people know. It's just about what you
know, and what you know about the things you know.

## Known unknowns

Imagine that knowledge is contained in atomic pieces. And you can either
know them, or not. And you can be aware of them, or not.

Knowing it means you're informed about its contents. You've assimilated it.
You own it.

Being aware of it means **you know that it exists**, and even that you
know how it would fit in the broader scheme. You've seen it.

According to the known unknowns framework, there are four categories in
which a _piece of knowledge_ can fit into:

- **known knowns**: things you know (and are aware of it),
- **unknown knowns**: things you know even if you're unaware of (intuition),
- **known unknowns**: things you're aware of, but don't know; and
- **unknown unknowns**: things you're unaware of, and don't know.

Now, I'm gonna describe what I believe is a sensibly accurate abstraction
of the learning proccess of something you're unfamiliar with.

## Learning the unfamiliar

First you give an bird's-eye view of the topic. You start to be aware of some
core concepts and their connections. **You may not know anything about them,
but you're aware of them.**
These pieces are represented in gray, and are your **known unknowns**.

Then you start exploring, and after some research, practice, time,
and sleep, you start to learn some of those pieces ---represented in black.

You're converting known unknowns into **known knowns**.

You may even start extending your awareness network, and find new links between
pieces (there are more gray circles now).

And even if you don't know it, you may start to make connections you're
unaware of. It may be because of a structural resemblance to completely
different topics, previous experience, or implicit hints you picked up.

You're building intuition. These are your **unknown knowns**.

![alt](/img/writings/unknown-unknowns/intuition-map.png)

But even with that knowledge, you're still ignorant.
Not because you don't know some of the pieces. **But because you're not even
aware of them.** You still have **unknown unknowns**.

![alt](/img/writings/unknown-unknowns/unawareness-map.png)

They may be unimportant pieces that getting to learn may not even worth the
effort. But they also may be important pieces that are fundamental to building
a more robust network.

## Growing your awareness

I believe that moving those **unknown unknowns** into your **known unknowns**
is a responsible objective to pursue.
It can help you to discover the hidden roadmap behind the fog.

The only question is how to do it, and I can only think of two ways:

1. **Diversifying your interests**. 

    I think that the structural resemblance of different topics can make you
    develop the intuition that can help you realize you're missing pieces.

    You may be learning economics and realize that there is some resemblance to
    the cycle of water, for example.

2. **Giving a bird's-eye view every once in a while**.

    The more knowledge you acquire, the easier it could be to find unpolished
    links, or gaps.

## Conclusion

But now, of course, reality is not that simple.

You can't just pinpoint and say ---yeah, that's one piece of knowledge.
And that's another right there!---.

Knowledge it's not self-contained. It has many dimensions. Even a single
"piece" contains networks of smaller pieces. Links between pieces go beyond
what you can imagine, and a true learning roadmap may not be as organized
as a concept map.


Finally, getting back to the original idea, I think this may help you both
as a solo developer and as a team member.

As a solo developer, you could improve your ability to think with different
perspectives, broadening your _"toolkit"_.

Knowing that there's a thing called memoization that caches return values
may help you write more a more efficient function one day (or never, but
let's stick with the possibility of that one day), even if you don't know
the specifics of it. You can go back and research it when needed.

And as a team member, you can strive to make a smoother flow of work
between teams.
You don't need to know what your pals on other teams do, but if you are aware
of their tasks, (and you're kind enough) you'll make an effort to fit your
work to ease theirs.

It'd be like striving to specify an interface between developers.

At the end, what I want to force myself to do, is not just accept and 
embrace ignorance, but make an effort to fight it at least by increasing
the size of my awareness network. Getting to know my unknown unknowns.
