Ever since I started scrobbling to Last.fm, I've been recomending it to all my friends.

I just love the idea of keeping track of what you listen, abling you to find patterns; discover
your **actual** favorite artists, songs, and albums; and visualizing or analyzing that data with
different tools available online.

Although they're very cool, I decided that I'd like to make my own. Trying to learn several things while
doing it.

The most recent stable version is available at [last.fm stats][lastfmstats]. You can also take a look
at [the repository][repository]. You're welcome to collaborate!

**This is a work in progress and I haven't delivered a v1.0.0 yet.**
