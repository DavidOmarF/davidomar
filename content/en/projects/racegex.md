After starting to learn regular expressions, and realizing that once you learn
the basic syntax, understanding them is easy, me and a friend decided to create
one place to compete using regular expressions.

Racing to write one that matches all the positive test cases, without matching
any of the negative test cases.

Then scoring them in efficiency and robustness.

After the first iterations, Racegex became not only a racing game, but a
platform to learn and practice regular expressions for beginners.
