I presented "**_Generative Art: Quick introduction to start producing algorithmic visual art_**"
at **Eventloop** for their [September 2019][meetup-eventloop] meetup.

You can see the [slides][slides] and the [repository][repository] that contains them.

## Why?

Generative Art has been increasingly interesting for me since March 2018.
Although is a pretty recent interest in my life, and I don't have enough experience
to consider myself a reputable artist, I challenged myself to give a presentation
about the topic. 

So one week before the event I submitted the talk proposal, and after being accepted,
I started preparing the presentation.

The original presentation I prepared took me around 60 minutes to present, but I had to
make it fit a 20 minutes time frame, so I ended cutting a big chunk of content.

I wrote [an essay][essay] that accompanies the presentation. I'm planning on sharing
it on [Generative Mistakes][gen-mistakes] and extending it into a series of articles.

This was the first iteration of the talk. I'm planning on giving several more.
