      <title>Data Structures for Subway Networks</title>

      <description>Currently I&amp;rsquo;m developing a twitter bot that will share a generated subway network everyday. The first step is writing the code that will produce the network.
The first problem arised when I tried to decide how to represent it.
Originally, I only thought of generating individual lines, represented in arrays, with each element (station) containing a pair of (x, y) coordinates. But sooner than later I found problems with that approach.</description>

      <title>Pushing to Git Submodules Without Affecting Original Remote</title>

      <description>Just today I started working with Hugo. The default way to install themes in your website is adding the theme repository as a git submodule.
Doing so, produces this structure:
-/mySite ├── .git ## Contains the git info of mySite ├── .gitmodules ## References the repositoriy added as submodule ├── themes/ ├── niceTheme/ ├── .git ## Contains the git info of niceTheme  I originally assumed there would be no problem if I modified the files inside niceTheme normally, like I did when using Jekyll themes, and then push all the changes to my repo.</description>

      <title>New Beginnings (again)</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been rebooting my website at least once a year since I started it.
Originally built with WordPress, adapted to Jekyll, and then decomposed into different websites (a personal blog, and a blog about art), this particular domain was pretty much forgotten by me.
Even though it was meant to be a blog, I only used it as a landing page. The information in here eventually got outdated, and the whole project evolved into a chunk of text that I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to touch out of lazyness.</description>
